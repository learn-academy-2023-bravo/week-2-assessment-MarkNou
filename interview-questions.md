# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a piece of a function. It can take in a value and apply it to a function. An argument is whats invoked in a function call and passed into a parameter. 

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable that is part of a of a function. Its a place holder for an input thats passed through an argument.
An argument is a value that is passed to a function when it is called. Arguments are passed to a function by assigning them to the corresponding parameters in the function's signature.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() is a higher order of functions method. It takes in an array and iterates through the values. 

Researched answer: The .map() method is a built-in method in JavaScript that is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element in an array. The method takes in an array and iterates through the values. With .map(), a value is required. The index and array are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map() and .filter() are both higher order of fucntion methods. .map() iterates through each value and returns an array with the same length. .filter() uses a conditional statement to iterate through values and returns an array if a condition is met.

Researched answer: .map() returns a new array by transforming every value in a function. .map() returns an array with the same length as the array that is taken in as an argument. .filter() takes in an array and creates a new array if the data passed through meets it's conditions. .filter() can return an array that is the same length or smaller.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: An iteration is an action that passes every value in a dataset and performs an action on it. This can include arithemetics, conditional statements, string interpolation, and relative statements.

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met. Iteration loops over arrays, objects, and other data structures to perform certain operations on them.

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Functions are blocks of code that can be invoked with different arguments over and over again. A method is a similar to a function in that it performs an action on a given piece of data. The differece is that a method is directly applied to a piece of data in a chain

Researched answer: Functions are a reusable block of code that performs a task, and can take in data as an argument via a parameter. Functions can be called anywhere, and return different results based on the input. A method is a function thats associated with an object or class. When calling a method, it is defined to a specific piece of data.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting allows a function to be called before its declared. 

Researched answer: Hoisting is a behavior that allows varaibles and function declarations to be moved before they are actually executed. This allows you to invoke a function before it is actually declared.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: A component is a function in react that can be used over and over again. It is used for front-end development. Components combine JavaScript and html and are highly custamizable.

2. Spread operator: A spread operator allows you to copy an array and expand it into a new array, or extract values into a different array.

3. React state: A state is an object that is used within a component. It can be used to store data that is inputed, making it highly dynamic.

4. React props: React props are arguments passed into react components. They are passed through via HTML.

5. DOM events: DOM events are invoked by users interacting with the graphic user interface.
